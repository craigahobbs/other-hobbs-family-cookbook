# The Other Hobbs Family Cookbook

Welcome to The Other Hobbs Family Cookbook! This is a random, and constantly growing and changing,
collection of recipes that I've come across over the years. Some recipes I've tweaked a bit. Enjoy!

The source code for the cookbook is [here](https://github.com/craigahobbs/other-hobbs-family-cookbook#readme).

This cookbook is viewed above using the [Markdown Book](https://github.com/craigahobbs/markdown-book#readme) application.
