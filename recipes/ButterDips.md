1/4 cup unsalted butter

1 1/4 cups flour

2 teaspoons sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon salt

2/3 cup milk
~~~


### Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 450 F. Cut the butter into pieces and place them in a 9-inch-square baking dish.
   Put the baking dish in the oven to melt the butter. This will take about 5 minutes; remove the
   baking dish once the butter has completely melted.

2. While the butter is melting, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large
   mixing bowl.

3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and form into a long, narrow rectangle. Cut the dough
   into 12 equal strips.

4. Turn each strip in the melted butter and place in the baking dish.

5. Bake for 15 minutes or until puffed and golden.
