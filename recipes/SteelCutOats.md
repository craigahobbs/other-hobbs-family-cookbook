    '1 C steel-cut oats', \
    '3 C water' \
)

Close the pressure cooker lid and cook for 3 minutes at high pressure.

When cooking is complete, release pressure using the natural release method (about 15 minutes)
before releasing the remaining pressure.

The oats will be watery when you remove the lid from the pot, but they will continue to thicken.
