In a large bowl, mix together:

recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2 C all-purpose flour', \
    '2 tbsp sugar', \
    '1 tbsp baking powder', \
    '1/4 tsp salt' \
))
~~~

Cut in the plant-based butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs:

    '1/3 C plant-based butter' \

Add the non-dairy milk and vanilla extract, stirring until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2/3 C non-dairy milk (almond, oat, soy)', \
    '1 teaspoon vanilla extract' \
))
~~~

Transfer the dough to a floured surface and shape it into a round disk (about 1 inch thick). Cut the disk into wedges or
use a round cutter for traditional scone shapes. Place the scones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Bake for 12-15 minutes at 400 F oven, until golden on top.
