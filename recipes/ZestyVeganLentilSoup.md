## Instructions:

1. **Sauté the Base:** Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion,
   carrots, and celery. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the veggies soften and
   the onion turns translucent.

2. **Add the Spices:** Stir in the minced garlic, cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, and cayenne
   pepper (if using). Cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant, letting the spices
   bloom.

3. **Combine Main Ingredients:** Add the rinsed lentils, diced tomatoes (with their juices),
   vegetable broth, and water. Stir well to combine everything.

4. **Simmer:** Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for
   25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender and the soup thickens slightly.

5. **Add Zest and Greens:** Stir in the lemon juice, lemon zest, and turmeric. If using spinach or
   kale, add it now and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and black
   pepper to taste.

6. **Serve:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley. For an extra
   zesty touch, squeeze a little more lemon juice on top before serving.
