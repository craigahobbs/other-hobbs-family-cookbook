Stir together in a mixing bowl and let stand for 10 minutes:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '1 3/4 C warm water (110 degrees)', \
    '1 Tbsp dry yeast', \
    '2 tsp sugar' \
)
~~~

In a power mixer with the bread hook, mix:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '4 1/2 C flour', \
    '2 tsp salt', \
    '2 Tbsp olive oil' \
)
~~~

With the motor running, slowly add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients until a soft dough
forms. Turn the mixer off and extract the dough ball and turn it into a greased bowl.

Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise until double. "Punch" the dough down and divide it into
individual dough balls.

Roll each ball out on a floured surface and place it on an oiled baking pan. Cover the crust with
[pizza sauce](#categories.0=Extras&categories.1=Recipes&id=recipes-PizzaSauce), shredded mozzarella
or Colby-Jack cheese, and toppings as desired.

Bake in a 425-degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes until cheese is bubbly and crust is brown.
