Title: Pizza Crust
~~~

### Ingredients

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

3/4 cup lukewarm water

1 tablespoon olive oil
~~~


### Instructions

Mix and knead all of the ingredients to make a smooth, pliable dough. Cover the dough and let it rise at room
temperature for 30 minutes, or in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.

Roll the dough into a 12" circle. Transfer the crust to a piece of parchment (if you're baking on a stone), or a lightly
oiled pizza pan, and let it rest for about 20 minutes. While it's resting, preheat the oven to 450 F.

Top the crust as desired. Bake until the edges are crisp and the sauce or cheese is bubbling, about 14 to 18 minutes.
Remove the pizza from the oven, and enjoy hot or warm.
