    '2 C all-purpose flour', \
    '3 tbsp sugar', \
    '1 tbsp baking powder', \
    '1/2 tsp salt', \
    '1 3/4 C milk', \
    '1/3 C vegetable oil', \
    '2 large eggs' \

For 6 1/2 inch round waffles, pour 1/2 cup batter onto the hot waffle maker.

Left-over waffles freeze well in aluminum foil or plastic wrap for toasting later in your toaster.
